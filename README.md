## 🌟 Overview

**compliance-gpt** is an AI-assisted tool designed to help compliance teams manage plan document compliance more effectively. It automates the reconciliation, exception tracking, and sign-off workflows that help maintain qualified plan status during recordkeeper conversions and cycle restatements.

## ❓ The Problem

When retirement plans switch providers or update their documents, compliance teams face significant challenges:

- They must ensure compliance with **IRC §401(a)** to maintain tax qualification.
- They need to meet ERISA and DOL obligations, which include maintaining written plans, records, and timely disclosures.
- It's vital to prove that the new documents accurately represent the old documents or that any changes were properly approved.

Historically, compliance teams handle this through manual means, using Word files for redlining, Excel for tracking, and emails for communication. This process is slow, prone to error, and does not scale effectively.

## 🛠️ What compliance-gpt Does

compliance-gpt streamlines and automates the four-control framework outlined in the `/process` directory:

1. **Plan Qualification** — Confirms document lineage and checks Opinion Letter reliance.
2. **Documentation Analysis** — Compares documents to ensure consistency and identifies any changes.
3. **Exception Tracking** — Automates the tracking of any exceptions or deviations from compliance.
4. **Sign-off Workflows** — Facilitates easy documentation for sign-offs to ensure all compliance requirements are met.

By automating these tasks, compliance-gpt significantly reduces time and effort, allowing teams to focus on more strategic issues.
