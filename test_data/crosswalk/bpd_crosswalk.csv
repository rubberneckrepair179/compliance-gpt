The provisions serve different purposes and impose different requirements, affecting both plan operations and participant rights."

These provisions address fundamentally different aspects of plan administration (distribution of insurance/annuities vs. investment management authority), and do not represent the same rule or requirement. The difference could affect both participant rights (access to insurance/annuity distributions) and plan operations (who controls investments)."
